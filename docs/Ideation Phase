Project Title: Citizen AI

Project Type: AI-Powered Civic Assistant System

Introduction

Citizen AI is an innovative AI-powered solution designed to enhance communication and interaction between citizens and public service systems. In the digital age, our objective is to build a smart assistant that guides users through government services, automates repetitive tasks, and provides real-time intelligent support.

Problem Statement

Public services are often plagued by inefficiencies, limited accessibility, and delays. Citizens face obstacles when filing complaints, accessing welfare schemes, or navigating bureaucratic portals. Citizen AI aims to act as a digital bridge, simplifying this process.

Project Idea

The core idea is to build a web-based platform that uses artificial intelligence to:

Guide users in filling out forms.

Answer frequently asked questions.

Translate legal and bureaucratic language.

Recommend schemes and services based on user profiles.

Collect user feedback automatically.

Goals and Objectives

Develop a scalable and responsive web platform.

Integrate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.

Support multiple languages.

Provide a clean, intuitive user interface.
